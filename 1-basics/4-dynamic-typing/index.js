 * Notes
 *
 * JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means the type of variable

 * Using typeof variableName returns a string, the type of variable.
 * typeof name -> "string"
 *
 * In JavaScript, all numbers like integers and floating point are just grouped as a
 * general "number" type
