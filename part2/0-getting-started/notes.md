### What is OOP
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm centered around objects

### Four Pillars of OOP
* Encapsulation
  * Combining of properties and methods related with one another within an object
* Abstraction
  * Hiding complexities and only exposing simpler interfaces, thus resulting in less cascading, potentially-breaking changes
* Inheritance
  * Reducing redundancy
* Polymorphism
  * Method behaviors are dependent on the type of object

### ES6
* ECMA is an organization that is responsible for publishing the ECMAScript specification
  * ECMAScript 6 published in 2015 (most widely used)
* ES6 Classes are just syntactical sugar for prototypes and prototypical inheritance
